To many, a computer is a tool. To me, it feels more like a companion.

I have always possessed an infinite curiosity about the world — a need to understand how systems work, from the physics of light to the sociology of crowds. But the world is noisy, chaotic, and often irrational.

**Code is different.**

Code is the one place where logic always prevails. If a system breaks, it is not because the universe is unfair; it is because the logic is flawed. And logic can be fixed.

### The Dopamine of the Build

There is a specific psychological state that draws me to engineering: **Flow.**

When I am deep in a problem - building a system, refactoring a messy component, debugging a production issue, or optimizing a database query — time dilates. The external world fades away, and I am left with a pure feedback loop of _Hypothesis -> Action -> Result._

It is a form of play. It is a unique way of communicating ideas that language sometimes fails to capture.

### Why this blog exists

I built this site to document two things:

1.  **The Engineering:** The technical problems I solve and the stacks I use (React, Node, AI agents).
2.  **The Refactoring:** My attempt to apply this same engineering mindset to the messy, non-binary questions of life.

I hope to show that a developer's mind doesn't turn off when the terminal closes. We are always parsing, always optimizing, and always refactoring our understanding of the world.

Welcome to my world.

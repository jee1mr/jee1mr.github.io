We often talk about the "future" of human evolution as something distant - a biological merge with silicon that happens in a sterile lab a century from now. But I feel that we have already quietly transitioned into Homo Deus.

Everything I do now involves massive human-AI collaboration. We perform as a single, symbiotic unit. Whether I am writing code, architecting software, brainstorming ideas, or drafting posts, the output is the result of a continuous feedback loop between my intent and the AI’s execution.

This dynamic has created a strange paradox regarding ownership. I take 100% responsibility for the final output. If the code breaks, it’s on me, but I cannot claim 100% ownership of the creation. The core vision and the initial spark are mine, but the trajectory often shifts during our interaction. It isn’t fully me, and it isn’t fully the AI. It is a result of the union.

It reminds me of the Ship of Theseus paradox. If I provide the prompt (the keel) and the AI builds the structure (the planks), and I refine the style (the sails), and the AI optimizes the logic (the rudder) - at what point does it stop being "my" work?

This is fundamentally different from the tools of the past. Spell check, linters, and grammar guides were passive; they corrected errors. This is active. Like it or not, AI can "think". Critics love to dismiss Large Language Models as "stochastic parrots" merely predicting the next plausible word. But if that is the definition of a stochastic parrot, then we are forced to confront an uncomfortable truth: humans might be too. We are operating at similar cognitive levels now - predicting, synthesizing, and creating in a way that is becoming increasingly indistinguishable.

The era of Homo Deus has begun.

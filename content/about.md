## Hi, I’m Jeevan. 👋

I am a Software Engineer by trade and a curious human by nature.

This website is a monorepo for my life. While it hosts my technical portfolio, it also serves as a digital garden for my varied interests - from philosophy and software to classical music and fitness.

### 🧘 The Philosophy: Refactoring Life

I view life through the same lens I view software: as an infinite loop of learning, building, and optimizing.

Just as a codebase requires maintenance, my understanding of the world requires constant refactoring. I have made peace with the fact that I will never run out of questions, and that is a feature, not a bug.

### 🔍 What you'll find here

- 👨‍💻 **Engineering:** Practical tutorials, documentation of my work, and notes on the tech stack I use to build systems.
- 🧠 **The Infinite Refactor:** This features my essays on various topics - serving as living documents where I attempt to give structure to my raw thoughts. I treat them like open-source software, updating the "version" as my perspective evolves with age.
- 🧪 **Experiments:** My playground for AI agents, robotics, and whatever else captures my obsession this month.
